# vascan-data


## Migration from GoogleCode
Since April 10th 2015, VASCAN data issues are managed in this GitHub repository. All issues created prior to that date were moved using an [in-house script](https://github.com/Canadensys/vascan-data-googlecode-to-github).

Limitations:
 * Ownership was only retained for users with more than 10 issues
 * The order of the issues was not maintained but the order of comments inside each issues was maintained
 * Original creation date was retained in text only. The date displayed by GitHub correspond to the date/time the script was run.

All issues imported from Google Code contains a mention similar to `[Originally posted on GoogleCode (id 1134) on 2012-02-20]` 
indicating they were originaly on Google Code and were posted on the mentioned date. In case a GitHub user was used to create an issue 
for another Google Code user, the mention will look like `[Originally posted on GoogleCode (id 1954) on 2013-11-22 by john.doe`.
